This project is a school assignment of mine. It is an ASP.NET Core API that allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using asymmetric and symmetric algorithms.

## Building, testing and running

A .NET Core runtime is required. Run `dotnet build`, `dotnet test` and `dotnet run --project backend`, in that order.

## API documentation exploration

In development-mode builds, a Swagger doc page is exposed at `/swagger`.
